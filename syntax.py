# Syntax for variable names in python.
# The name of the variable should not start with a number e.g(1space).
# The name of the variable should not start with a any symbol(?,@).
# Dont leave spaces with compound variable names or names with morethan one word.(in such a case use undercores[_]) in between those words eg pay_as_you_earn or use carmel notation eg payAsYouEarn.
# Use relatable variable names e.g (net_income).
# It is recommended to start a variable name with small letters.
# While creating the variable name any variable should have a value.eg(salary = 1000).
# Try to use shorter variable names eg(sal meaning salary, net to mean net_pay ).
# Dont use special key words as names of variables










# Declaring variables
