# Python is a modular language eg we add in features in python.
# Python has different modules which can help you in building anthing eg  website
# A module(package is a directory) can be called a library but it can simply be a folder that has functions that can be re-used.
# A module is a file that has a script or functions that can be re-used.
# Each library has a specific function and the core function is called pil.
# the rest are just added onto pil by people.
# Python Anaconda has libraries that are used in data science and AI.
# python can work with other languages to achieve functionality. eg python and c to make cpy.
# a package folder is a folder that has most of the times an empty file called __init__.py.
# and we access it by importing it.
# python comes with libraries however we can create ours.
# but we can get others using a known package manager called pip for libraries or packages that dont come with python.
# we are to download django from pip for web development and web applications.
# same package name and same module name.
# turtle gives you graphical designing.
