styles of writing include object orientated programming(OOP)
    but earlier we hv been solving problems step by step(Structured programming).
But python does both.
OOP is a concept of programming that advocates creating software basing on real world objects. eg windows operating systems.
All objects come from what we call a class.
A class is a blue print of an object.(original)
An object is an instance of a class.(duplicate)
a blue print is a master copy of an object. eg the(object) duplicate of the original thing.(class)
therefore objects belong to a class.
Concepts in oop
Abstraction.
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapuslation.
Overloading and over riding.
