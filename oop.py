styles of writing include object orientated programming(OOP)
    but earlier we hv been solving problems step by step(Structured programming).
    SP is the process of solving the problem bit by bit.(to down approach)
But python does both.
OOP is a concept of programming that advocates creating software basing on real world objects.
 eg windows operating systems.
All objects come from what we call a class.
A class is a blue print of an object.(original)
An object is an instance of a class.(duplicate)
a blue print is a master copy of an object. eg the(object) duplicate of the original thing.(class)
therefore objects belong to a class.
Classes are written in singular e.g class student.
classes give us characteristics of objects.

If you want to identify a class of an object we use "is a".
Concepts in oop
Abstraction: Is the level of representation e.g. Animal().
    its what we use to identify classes.
    Something thats not definitive enough.
Inheritance: is the ability where an object can take on things from different classes.
    some things of an object can be diffent from that of the class.
    (an object has its own dfferent things)
Polymorphism: Here an object can take on different forms/classes.
    e.g a daughter in a class of a father.
Encapuslation: The ability to restrict some of the content from being accessed. 
    e.g classes or objects from being accessed.
